# A lightweight cross-platform replacement for System.Data.SQLite

This is an independent implementation of the core of ADO.NET: `IDbConnection`, `IDbCommand`, `IDbDataReader`, `IDbTransaction` (plus a few helpers) — enough types to let you create and query SQLite databases from managed code, including support for libraries such as [Dapper](https://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/).

It supports the following platforms: .NET 4.5 (Any CPU), Xamarin.iOS, PCL, MonoTouch, MonoAndroid.

If you’re looking for the official ADO.NET wrapper for [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/), it can be found at [http://system.data.sqlite.org/](http://system.data.sqlite.org/).

## Build Status

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/jr53ivspp87r1khl)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BradleyGrainger/system-data-sqlite)

## Why?

1. Lightweight
 * Only the core of ADO.NET is implemented, not EF or Designer types.
 * The official System.Data.SQLite is 276KB; this library is under 50KB.
2. High performance
 * This library assumes that the caller will use `IDisposable` properly, so it avoids adding finalizers to clean up incorrect usage.
 * No static constructors (e.g., `SQLiteFunction`) that reflect over all loaded assemblies.
3. Cross-platform support
 * Works on desktop and mobile devices
4. Tested
 * This implementation has been shipping in [Logos 6](https://www.logos.com/install) and installed on tens of thousands of client machines. The developers track and fix crashes reported via [Raygun](https://raygun.io/).

## Enhancements

* `DbDataReader.ReadAsync(CancellationToken)` is overridden to support cancellation from another thread (via [`sqlite_progress_handler`](http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/progress_handler.html)).
* Added [`SQLiteConnection.StatementCompleted`](https://github.com/LogosBible/System.Data.SQLite/search?q=StatementCompleted) to return the results of [`sqlite3_profile`](http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/profile.html).

## Compatibility

This library is generally compatible with the official System.Data.SQLite API, but a few changes were made where necessary:
* [SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder](https://github.com/LogosBible/System.Data.SQLite/blob/master/src/System.Data.SQLite/SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder.cs) does not support all the official connection string properties.
* [SQLiteDataReader](https://github.com/LogosBible/System.Data.SQLite/blob/master/src/System.Data.SQLite/SQLiteDataReader.cs) performs fewer implicit conversions.
* Not all SQL type aliases (`text`, `int`, `blob`, etc.) are supported.

This wrapper is managed-only; you still need a copy of the native SQLite library. A recent copy is provided in the `lib` folder (for the unit tests).
